Impressive things have been done?!
So What prototype do you guys want to do as the simpler one?
looks like the best one to begin with is the First one. 
Might have to change or add some mechanics.
 I am planning on adding multiple levels or some thing :p 
The first prototype and the last prototype are the ones I feel we can expand on the most with.
